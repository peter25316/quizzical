QUIZZICAL

Quzzical is a web application that allows users to test their knowledge by answering trivia questions. The app fetches questions from an external API and displays them on the website, allowing users to select their answers and receive feedback on their performance.

The app is built using Node.js and JavaScript, with a REST API for communicating with the external API. The frontend is built using React.js, HTML, and CSS to provide an interactive and responsive user interface.

The project is deployed using Vercel, a cloud platform for serverless deployment of web applications. This provides a reliable and scalable infrastructure for the app, with automatic scaling to handle increased traffic.

This project was a personal project that allowed me to explore and develop my skills in full-stack web development, including working with external APIs, building RESTful APIs, and using modern frontend frameworks.
